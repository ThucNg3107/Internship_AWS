#### Deployment architecture

![CloudBrief Architecture](/images/5-Workshop/5.3-S3-vpc/cloudbrief.png)

CloudFront is the single public entry point. AWS WAF protects the distribution; S3 serves the private frontend through Origin Access Control; `/api/*` is forwarded to an internet-facing Application Load Balancer. The ALB targets two EC2 instances in private subnets. A NAT Gateway handles external RSS, Hacker News, and article fetches, while four VPC endpoints keep SQS, Bedrock, S3, and DynamoDB traffic on AWS networking.

#### Deployment chapters

1. [Build and synthesize locally](5.3.1-create-gwe/)
2. [Deploy the production stack](5.3.2-test-gwe/)
